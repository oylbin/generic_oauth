# Generic Oauth

## Description

`generic_oauth` makes it extremely simple to use any OAuth v2 API purely from the command line.

Typically browsers are a required component of the Oauth flowâ€”APIs use html pages to allow users to grant permisson to third party apps to make requests on their behalf. This makes it easy for web-apps to use oauth apis, but difficult and clunkly for command-line apps to use these services. 

With `generic_oauth` you can synchronosly generate access_tokens for any oauth api with just a few lines of code. 

Implementations included: 

- Google
- Github
- Facebook
- Spotify

## Sample Usage

```
import secrets
import requests
from generic_oauth import SpotifyOAuth

# Get a spotify access_token in just 2 lines. 
o = SpotifyOAuth(secrets.client_id, secrets.client_secret, secrets.redirect_uri, secrets.scope_string)
access_data = o.get_access_code()

headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + access_data['access_token']}
r = requests.get('https://api.spotify.com/v1/me', headers=headers)
print r.json()

```

## Documentation

`OAuthWebFlowController` is an abstract class responsible for handling the bulk of the oauth 2.0 web flow. To implement a handler for an OAuth api not already included, you will need to make a subclass of this class and override the `authorization_url()` and `parse_temp_code()` methods.

`OAuthWebFlowController` creates a temporarly local HTTP server to accept data sent to the `redirect_uri`. This server defaults on port 5555, but you can change this. See the `port` in the `__init__` method.
